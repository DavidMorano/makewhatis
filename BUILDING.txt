BUILDING

This was built using a small Makefile and one source code file.
The source code is C++20 and the GCC-13 compiler suite was used to
compile it.  One shell script ('ma') is also provided to setup a
minimal environment for the make-build process.  Most any developer
should be able to adapt this small distribution to build in their
systemenvironment.

What I do (in the end)?

$ cd src
$ ma
